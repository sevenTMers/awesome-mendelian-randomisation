# Aweseome Mendelian Randomisation [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) 

A curated list of awesome Mendelian Randomisation frameworks, libraries, software and resources.

What is Mendelian Randomisation? 

The use of genetic data to infer causal relationship in disease or: 

>  Mendelian Randomisations estimate the [causal relationship](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350-reprint.pdf) of a risk factor of interest to disease outcomes using genetic variants as instruments to index the risk factor. [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16969-0)

Mendelian Randomisation operates under 3 assumptions:
* There is a gene variant that effects the biomarker of interest (G	is	robustly	associated	with	X)
* The gene variant only changes that biomarker (No	confounding) 
* The effect of the variant on the disease is only through the vehicle of that biomarker (No	pleiotropy)

* [BenevolentAi Funds Doctorate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/aihealth-cdt/combining-mendelian-randomisation-and-machine-learning-drug-target-validation-complex-disease) for 'Combining Mendelian randomisation and machine learning for drug target validation in complex disease' and attempted to answer three questions
  1. Can machine learning and advanced data science be used to optimise the construction of genetic instruments for use in MR for drug target validation?
  2. Can machine learning methods optimise the application of MR to drug target validation by detecting and accounting for genetic pleiotropy?
  3. Can a combination of machine learning and MR methods be used to prioritise drug targets and elaborate the molecular and physiological pathways involved in the efficacy and safety of a drug target?
  * These questions will be addressed using large volumes of summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and individual level data from population studies (e.g. [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)).
